### Dictionary Keys
Key | Input Type | Accessed Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**official_name** | None, str,  | NoneClass, str,  | The official name of the account as given by the financial institution | 
**balances** | [**AccountBalance**](AccountBalance.md) | [**AccountBalance**](AccountBalance.md) |  | 
**account_id** | str,  | str,  | Plaidâ€™s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can&#x27;t reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new &#x60;account_id&#x60; will be assigned to the account.  The &#x60;account_id&#x60; can also change if the &#x60;access_token&#x60; is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that &#x60;access_token&#x60; are used to generate a new &#x60;access_token&#x60; on a later date. In that case, the new &#x60;account_id&#x60; will be different from the old &#x60;account_id&#x60;.  If an account with a specific &#x60;account_id&#x60; disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  Like all Plaid identifiers, the &#x60;account_id&#x60; is case sensitive. |
