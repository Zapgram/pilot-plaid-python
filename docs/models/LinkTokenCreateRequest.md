**[country_codes](#country_codes)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will be shown. For a complete mapping of supported products by country, see https://plaid.com/global/.  If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. Access to European institutions requires additional compliance steps. To request access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.  If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in &#x60;country_codes&#x60;, or the customization may not be applied.  If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or Automated Micro-deposits, &#x60;country_codes&#x60; must be set to &#x60;[&#x27;US&#x27;]&#x60;. | 
**language** | str,  | str,  | The language that Link should be displayed in. When initializing with Identity Verification, this field is not used; for more details, see [Identity Verification supported languages](https://www.plaid.com/docs/identity-verification/#supported-languages).  Supported languages are: - Danish (&#x60;&#x27;da&#x27;&#x60;) - Dutch (&#x60;&#x27;nl&#x27;&#x60;) - English (&#x60;&#x27;en&#x27;&#x60;) - Estonian (&#x60;&#x27;et&#x27;&#x60;) - French (&#x60;&#x27;fr&#x27;&#x60;) - German (&#x60;&#x27;de&#x27;&#x60;) - Italian (&#x60;&#x27;it&#x27;&#x60;) - Latvian (&#x60;&#x27;lv&#x27;&#x60;) - Lithuanian (&#x60;&#x27;lt&#x27;&#x60;) - Norwegian (&#x60;&#x27;no&#x27;&#x60;) - Polish (&#x60;&#x27;pl&#x27;&#x60;) - Portuguese (&#x60;&#x27;pt&#x27;&#x60;) - Romanian (&#x60;&#x27;ro&#x27;&#x60;) - Spanish (&#x60;&#x27;es&#x27;&#x60;) - Swedish (&#x60;&#x27;sv&#x27;&#x60;)  When using a Link customization, the language configured here must match the setting in the customization, or the customization will not be applied. | 
**client_name** | str,  | str,  | The name of your application, as it should be displayed in Link. Maximum length of 30 characters. If a value longer than 30 characters is provided, Link will display \&quot;This Application\&quot; instead. | 
**user** | [**LinkTokenCreateRequestUser**](LinkTokenCreateRequestUser.md) | [**LinkTokenCreateRequestUser**](LinkTokenCreateRequestUser.md) |  | 
**client_id** | str,  | str,  | Your Plaid API &#x60;client_id&#x60;. The &#x60;client_id&#x60; is required and may be provided either in the &#x60;PLAID-CLIENT-ID&#x60; header or as part of a request body. | [optional] 
**secret** | str,  | str,  | Your Plaid API &#x60;secret&#x60;. The &#x60;secret&#x60; is required and may be provided either in the &#x60;PLAID-SECRET&#x60; header or as part of a request body. | [optional] 
**[products](#products)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use. If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted (unless you are using update mode to add Income or Assets to an Item); required otherwise.  &#x60;balance&#x60; is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.  The products specified here will determine which institutions will be available to your users in Link. Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; a if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a \&quot;Connectivity not supported\&quot; error message will appear in Link. To maximize the number of institutions available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be included via the [&#x60;required_if_supported_products&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-required-if-supported-products) field, or can be initialized by calling the endpoint after obtaining an access token. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).  Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if &#x60;auth&#x60; is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain &#x60;auth&#x60; in their product array.  In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via &#x60;/item/remove&#x60;. | [optional] 
**[additional_consented_products](#additional_consented_products)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | (Beta) This field has no effect unless you are participating in the [Data Transparency](https://plaid.com/docs/link/data-transparency-messaging-migration-guide) beta program. List of additional Plaid product(s) you wish to collect consent for. These products will not be billed until you start using them by calling the relevant endpoints.  &#x60;balance&#x60; is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically have consent collected.  Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link | [optional] 
**[required_if_supported_products](#required_if_supported_products)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use only if the institution and account(s) selected by the user support the product. Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link. The products will only be extracted and billed if the user selects an institution and account type that supports them.  There should be no overlap between &#x60;products&#x60; and &#x60;required_if_supported_products&#x60;. The &#x60;products&#x60; array must have at least one product.

**link_customization_name** | str,  | str,  | The name of the Link customization from the Plaid Dashboard to be applied to Link. If not specified, the &#x60;default&#x60; customization will be used. When using a Link customization, the language in the customization must match the language selected via the &#x60;language&#x60; parameter, and the countries in the customization should match the country codes selected via &#x60;country_codes&#x60;. | [optional] 
**redirect_uri** | str,  | str,  | A URI indicating the destination where a user should be forwarded after completing the Link flow; used to support OAuth authentication flows when launching Link in the browser or via a webview.

To specify any subdomain, use &#x60;*&#x60; as a wildcard character, e.g. &#x60;https://*.example.com/oauth.html&#x60;. Note that any redirect URI must also be added to the Allowed redirect URIs list in the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api).

# country_codes

Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will be shown. For a complete mapping of supported products by country, see https://plaid.com/global/.  If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. Access to European institutions requires additional compliance steps. To request access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.  If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in `country_codes`, or the customization may not be applied.  If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or Automated Micro-deposits, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.
