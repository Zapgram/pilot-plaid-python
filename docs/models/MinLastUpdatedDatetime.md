# plaid.model.min_last_updated_datetime.MinLastUpdatedDatetime

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.  If the balance that is pulled for `ins_128026` (Capital One) is older than the given timestamp, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.  This field is only used when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One), in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, this field is ignored.
