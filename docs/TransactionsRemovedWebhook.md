# TransactionsRemovedWebhook

Fired when transaction(s) for an Item are deleted. The deleted transaction IDs are included in the webhook payload. Plaid will typically check for deleted transaction data several times a day.  This webhook is intended for use with `/transactions/get`; if you are using the newer `/transactions/sync` endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.
