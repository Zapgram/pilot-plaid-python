### Dictionary Keys
Key | Input Type | Accessed Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**unofficial_currency_code** | None, str,  | NoneClass, str,  | The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if &#x60;iso_currency_code&#x60; is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported &#x60;unofficial_currency_code&#x60;s. | 
**current** | None, decimal.Decimal, int, float,  | NoneClass, decimal.Decimal,  | The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  For &#x60;loan&#x60;-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (&#x60;ins_116944&#x60;). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account&#x27;s balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.  For &#x60;investment&#x60;-type accounts (or &#x60;brokerage&#x60;-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the &#x60;available&#x60; balance as provided by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;.  When returned by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;, this field may be &#x60;null&#x60;. When this happens, &#x60;available&#x60; is guaranteed not to be &#x60;null&#x60;. | value must be a 64 bit float
**available** | None, decimal.Decimal, int, float,  | NoneClass, decimal.Decimal,  | The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance typically equals the &#x60;limit&#x60; less the &#x60;current&#x60; balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance typically equals the &#x60;current&#x60; balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance does not include the overdraft limit.  For &#x60;investment&#x60;-type accounts (or &#x60;brokerage&#x60;-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the &#x60;available&#x60; balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  Note that not all institutions calculate the &#x60;available&#x60;  balance. In the event that &#x60;available&#x60; balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an &#x60;available&#x60; balance value of &#x60;null&#x60;.  Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;.  If &#x60;current&#x60; is &#x60;null&#x60; this field is guaranteed not to be &#x60;null&#x60;. | value must be a 64 bit float
**iso_currency_code** | None, str,  | NoneClass, str,  | The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if &#x60;unofficial_currency_code&#x60; is non-null. | 
**limit** | None, decimal.Decimal, int, float,  | NoneClass, decimal.Decimal,  | For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  In North America, this field is typically only available for &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts. | value must be a 64 bit float
**last_updated_datetime** | None, str, datetime,  | NoneClass, str,  | Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (&#x60;YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ&#x60;) indicating the last time that the balance for the given account has been updated  This is currently only provided when the &#x60;min_last_updated_datetime&#x60; is passed when calling &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60; for &#x60;ins_128026&#x60; (Capital One). | [optional] value must conform to RFC-3339 date-time
**any_string_name** | dict, frozendict.frozendict, str, date, datetime, uuid.UUID, int, float, decimal.Decimal, bool, None, list, tuple, bytes, io.FileIO, io.BufferedReader,  | frozendict.frozendict, str, decimal.Decimal, BoolClass, NoneClass, tuple, bytes, FileIO | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
