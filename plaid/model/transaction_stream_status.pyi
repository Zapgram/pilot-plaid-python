    The current status of the transaction stream.

`MATURE`: A `MATURE` recurring stream should have at least 3 transactions and happen on a regular cadence (For Annual recurring stream, we will mark it `MATURE` after 2 instances).

`EARLY_DETECTION`: When a recurring transaction first appears in the transaction history and before it fulfills the requirement of a mature stream, the status will be `EARLY_DETECTION`.

`TOMBSTONED`: A stream that was previously in the `EARLY_DETECTION` status will move to the `TOMBSTONED` status when no further transactions were found at the next expected date.

`UNKNOWN`: A stream is assigned an `UNKNOWN` status when none of the other statuses are applicable.
