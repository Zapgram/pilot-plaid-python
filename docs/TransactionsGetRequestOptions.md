All implementations are encouraged to set this field to &#x60;true&#x60; and use the &#x60;personal_finance_category&#x60; instead of &#x60;category&#x60;. Personal finance categories are the preferred categorization system for transactions, providing higher accuracy and more meaningful categories.  See the [&#x60;taxonomy csv file&#x60;](https://plaid.com/documents/transactions-personal-finance-category-taxonomy.csv) for a full list of personal finance categories.  Plaid is also introducing Category Rules - a new endpoint that will enable you to change the &#x60;personal_finance_category&#x60; for a transaction based on your usersâ€™ needs. When rules are set, the selected category will override the Plaid provided category. To learn more, send a note to transactions-feedback@plaid.com. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of False
