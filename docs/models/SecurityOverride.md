# plaid.model.security_override.SecurityOverride

Specify the security associated with the holding or investment transaction. When inputting custom security data to the Sandbox, Plaid will perform post-data-retrieval normalization and enrichment. These processes may cause the data returned by the Sandbox to be slightly different from the data you input. An ISO-4217 currency code and a security identifier (`ticker_symbol`, `cusip`, `isin`, or `sedol`) are required.
