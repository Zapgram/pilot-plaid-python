# ProcessorRecurringTransactionsUpdateWebhook

This webhook is only sent to [Plaid processor partners](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/).  Fired when recurring transactions data is updated. This includes when a new recurring stream is detected or when a new transaction is added to an existing recurring stream. The `RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE` webhook will also fire when one or more attributes of the recurring stream changes, which is usually a result of the addition, update, or removal of transactions to the stream.  After receipt of this webhook, the updated data can be fetched from `/processor/transactions/recurring/get`.
