**update_type** | str,  | str,  | Indicates whether an Item requires user interaction to be updated, which can be the case for Items with some forms of two-factor authentication.  &#x60;background&#x60; - Item can be updated in the background  &#x60;user_present_required&#x60; - Item requires user interaction to be updated | must be one of ["background", "user_present_required", ] 
**webhook** | None, str,  | NoneClass, str,  | The URL registered to receive webhooks for the Item. | 
**item_id** | str,  | str,  | The Plaid Item ID. The &#x60;item_id&#x60; is always unique; linking the same account at the same institution twice will result in two Items with different &#x60;item_id&#x60; values. Like all Plaid identifiers, the &#x60;item_id&#x60; is case-sensitive. | 
**[billed_products](#billed_products)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | A list of products that have been billed for the Item. The contents of this array will be mutually exclusive with &#x60;available_products&#x60;. Note - &#x60;billed_products&#x60; is populated in all environments but only requests in Production are billed. Also note that products that are billed on a pay-per-call basis rather than a pay-per-Item basis, such as &#x60;balance&#x60;, will not appear here.  | 
**consent_expiration_time** | None, str, datetime,  | NoneClass, str,  | The RFC 3339 timestamp after which the consent provided by the end user will expire. Upon consent expiration, the item will enter the &#x60;ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60; error state. To circumvent the &#x60;ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60; error and maintain continuous consent, the end user can reauthenticate via Linkâ€™s update mode in advance of the consent expiration time.  Note - This is only relevant for certain OAuth-based institutions. For all other institutions, this field will be null.  | value must conform to RFC-3339 date-time

**[products](#products)** | list, tuple,  | tuple,  | A list of initialized products for the Item. In almost all cases, this will be the same as the &#x60;billed_products&#x60; field. For some products, it is possible for the product to be initialized on an Item but not yet billed (e.g. Assets, before &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; has been called), in which case the product may appear in &#x60;products&#x60; but not in &#x60;billed_products&#x60;.  | [optional]
