# plaid.model.weak_alias_determination.WeakAliasDetermination

Names that are explicitly marked as low quality either by their `source` list, or by `plaid` by a series of additional checks done by Plaid. Plaid does not ever surface a hit as a result of a weak name alone. If a name has no quality issues, this value will be `none`.
